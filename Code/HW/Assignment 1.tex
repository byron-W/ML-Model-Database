\begin{enumerate}
    \item I have used databases for a long time now, both on a user level and on a developer level. I use apps like spotify, youtube, and instagram daily. Back in 2018 I developed a bot for my friends on an app called discord. That was my first time doing coding outside of the little I did in highschool. I used a lot of javascript and had used MySQL server hosted on my pc. I eventually shifted everything to an online server I bought for a few bucks a month. I haven't used either of those languages since around 2020 so this course is a nice refresher.
    \item Yes, I'm familiar with SQL. I've used MySQL in the past.
    \item I'm interested in actually learning SQL in a professional setting rather than having to learn it on my own.
    \item I have a friend who's a senior data analyst and he told me this class is necessary for finding a data analyst job so I'm looking forward to learning skills that will help me get there.
